# Flight Delay Prediction Using Weather Data

The objective of this Machine Learning (ML) project is to develop an accurate and efficient model for predicting flight delays based on weather data. By analyzing historical weather patterns and their impact on flight schedules, the model aims to provide valuable insights and improve decision-making for airlines, airports, and travelers.
